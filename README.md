jquery-image-scale
==================

Scale images based on a container size to fit them based on gravity and zoom
clipping using the container layout.

The plugin provides a single jquery function 
$('#.images').scaleImageToParent();

You can optionally pass a jquery selector for the parent. The first matching
parent will be used. The default is to attach to the first parent div.
